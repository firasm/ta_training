# Sli.do

Sli.do is an online polling service that is convenient and easy to use for the students, with no requirements for accounts or special hardware.
Student simply scan the QR code each class to get taken to the question page, or type in the event code (usually the name of the course, e.g., PHYS111).
This is a low-barrier way to get student participation in class questions without worrying about tracking individual students and enforcing attendance or correctness.

Unfortunately, this makes it somewhat more difficult on the teaching team because the questions on the slides usually need to be added to Sli.do so students see the clicker questions in the correct order.

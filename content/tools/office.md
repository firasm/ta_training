# Microsoft Office 365

UBC has an enterprise license with Microsoft to ensure that all data that is created on OneDrive and Office365 apps (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) through your UBC account will be stored on servers within Canada.
**This means that we are permitted to store personal information on Office365 apps when you are signed in through your UBC account.**

Even though it may be slightly more inconvenient, we will need to use Office365 apps whenever we are dealing with student personal information.
Here is a quick animation to show you how to share documents using Office365:

## Protecting Personal Information

Due to privacy reasons, instructors and teaching assistants are not permitted to use any cloud-based tool that stores students' personal information on servers located outside of Canada.
This includes most learning technologies, including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides etc...
In addition, unless explicit steps are taken to give students an alternative option, students cannot be required to use these tools.

[The UBC Privacy Fact sheet defines PI as:](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2020/01/Fact-Sheet-What-is-Personal-Information.pdf)

> Individuals may be identified using their name or another unique number or characteristic, eg. photograph, SIN number, fingerprint, CWL ID, employee number, or student ID. Any information that has a precise, direct connection with one of these personal identifiers is personal information.

What this means is that we need to be very careful about the tools that we use in our course, and how it is framed to the students.
Part of this care includes educating the students about protecting their personal information and their [digital footprint](https://it.wisc.edu/news/data-privacy-101-whats-your-digital-footprint/), so it is worth it for TAs (in positions of authority) to model good behaviour and online habits.
Encourage students to ask questions about this, and if you're not comfortable answering their questions, direct them to your instructor.

## Install Microsoft Office

All UBC students have free access to a Microsoft Office 365 annual subscription, which is renewed for students enrolled in at least one course.
Office 365 includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote, and is available on a variety of platforms.

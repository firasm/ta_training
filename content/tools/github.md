# GitHub

Most of the computer science and data science courses I teach will use version control with git and the cloud-based repository hub, GitHub.com.
If you are not familiar with GitHub, it may be worth it for you to pay extra attention to the material I teach the students in the first 2-3 weeks of the course as it gets them all up-to-speed with Git.
If you need extra help and support, please do not hesitate to ask me as it's very important your systems are configured correctly so you can complete your tasks effectively.

# Submitting a lab on behalf of a student

This is usually done to submit a lab on behalf of a student to handle an extension request.

1. Open PrairieLearn, and select the right term.

2. Go to the gradebook, search for the student and get their UID (for e.g., mycwl@ubc.ca).

3. On the right of the menu, click drop down arrow beside your name, add the UID to the box, and then click "Change UID" to change the effective user to the student on whose behalf you are submitting.

4. Now that you're acting on behalf of the student, at the top right of the screen, click the dropdown menu, and click "Student view without access restrictions".

5. Click on the Assignment you want to submit and complete the assignment on the student's behalf.
